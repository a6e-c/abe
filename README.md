I'm a 24 year old Guatemalan college graduate. I enjoy drawing, playing soccer and making people laugh. I would like to be a TKH Fellow
because I am, among other things, analytical and creative, a skillset that I feel I've rarely used in combination. I want to learn to
code to use my strengths to make a difference. I admittedly don't know how I will do this if I complete the program, but aquiring this
skill of the new age will put me in a position to zero in on this wide, unfocused goal.
